      <description>Upgrade today!!   Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about Python 2to3, an automated code translator. This is a great tool to convert your python2 project to python3.
 Why you should move to python 3.x? Checkout https://pythonclock.org/ (If that link is no more available, I have added the screenshot below)   Python 2 reached end of life (EOL) on January 1st, 2020   And python3 supports typing (üòç) and a lot more (will cover it some other time).</description>

      <description>Information about internal package , _ and . imports in Golang!
  If you come across any package named internal or you write a package with the name internal then it is treated special in Golang world! Only question to ask about it is, Who can import this internal package?
And the answer is, any file out side the package containing internal package can NOT import internal because the name is self explanatory.</description>

      <description>If you have push access to an upstream repository and want to avoid accidental push, checkout the simple solution below.
  Freedom is choosing your responsibility. It‚Äôs not having no responsibilities; it‚Äôs choosing the ones you want.   Let‚Äôs set the context I will call the original repository as upstream My fork for that repository will be called as origin 90% of times I push to origin and then create pull request, but few times I push directly to upstream(create new branch or update existing one).</description>

      <title>Update golang version on Fedora</title>
      <link>https://pranavgore09.github.io/blogs/golang_update/</link>

      <description>Find out where Golang is installed, generally on the fedora it is /usr/local/go Or if you have custom location then check with echo $GOROOT and go to the location and rename go directory using sudo mv go go1.7.3. We keep older version for safety.
Now, go to https://golang.org/dl/ and download suitable version for your system. Lets say downloaded file is in ~/Downloads/ and then execute following (modify paths as required)</description>
